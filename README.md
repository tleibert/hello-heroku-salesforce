# Python: Getting Started

Forked from [the offical heroku getting started python project.](https://github.com/heroku/python-getting-started)
Abarebones Django app, which can easily be deployed to Heroku.

I've extended this project by adding the [simple-salesforce](https://github.com/simple-salesforce/simple-salesforce) package, and using it to fetch data from my Salesforce developer instance and display said data in an HTML table.

## This project is deployed [here](https://young-lake-06496.herokuapp.com/).
